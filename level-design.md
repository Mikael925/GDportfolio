            <h3>Gp1: Tom the dragon</h3>
            <p>In this group project, we created a platformer where you play as a dragon escaping a volcanic eruption. With lava rising, the goal is to flee the area. I took on the roles of both Product Owner and Level Designer. For the level design, my goal was to challenge the player while establishing a solid foundation for future development, resulting in a well-sized vertical slice.</p>

            <p>In this project, our team focused on designing a linear, narrative-driven level. It was built to guide the player through a complete mission, taking them from a set starting point to a final objective. The level features three distinct areas: the Village, the Church, and the Ritual Site.</p>
